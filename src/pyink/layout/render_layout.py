"""Render a :class:`LayoutNode` tree to a string (PR3 + PR4).

The renderer walks the layout tree and writes each text leaf into a 2D
character grid keyed by the leaf's absolute coordinates. Cells are then
joined into lines separated by ``\\n``; trailing whitespace is stripped
from each line (matching ink's behaviour — padding/gap filler that lives
at the end of a row must not leak into the snapshot).

Wide characters (CJK / most emoji) occupy two cells. ANSI escape
sequences are passed through verbatim without consuming any cell.

PR4 additions on top of PR3:

* Text leaves are wrapped with :func:`pyink.render.ansi.apply_style`
  when the originating element props carry colour / bold / italic /
  underline / strikethrough / inverse / dimColor.
* Box hosts paint a background fill across their content area when
  ``backgroundColor`` is set, then draw a border around the outer
  edge when ``borderStyle`` is set. Border cells are reserved in the
  layout pass (``FlexStyle`` folds them into padding) so the renderer
  simply writes the characters at the box's coordinate frame.
