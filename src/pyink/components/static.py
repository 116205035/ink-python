"""``Static`` — permanently render a list of items above the live frame (PR7).

Mirrors ink's ``<Static>``: items passed to ``Static`` are rendered exactly
once and written to stdout *above* the live frame. Already-rendered items
are never re-painted by the frame diff, so they accumulate like ordinary
log output and scroll off the top of the viewport naturally.

API:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyink import Static, Text, signal

    log = signal([])

    def App():
        return Box(
            Static(log, lambda item, idx: Text(item)),
            Text(lambda: f"Total: {len(log.value)} items"),
            flexDirection="column",
        )

The first argument (``items``) may be:

* a plain ``list[T]`` — rendered once on mount and never updated,
* a :class:`pyink.core.signal.Signal` wrapping ``list[T]``,
* or a ``Callable[[], list[T]]`` evaluated inside a reactive effect.

In the reactive cases a new render is performed only for the items
appended since the last flush; items that disappeared or moved are not
re-rendered or erased (matching ink's semantics — Static is append-only).

The ``render_item`` callback receives ``(item, index)`` and must return an
:class:`pyink.core.element.Element`. Each item is rendered via
:func:`pyink.render.render_to_string` with the current terminal width, so
ANSI styling (colour, bold, …) is honoured.

Implementation notes:

* Because PyInk function-component bodies run exactly once on mount, the
  incremental-flush logic lives inside a reactive :func:`effect` that
  re-runs whenever the items source changes.
* The component returns an empty ``box`` host flagged ``_pyink_static=True``.
  The layout engine (:func:`pyink.layout.flex.build_flex_tree`) treats
  that sentinel as zero-sized, so it never participates in flex layout
  nor appears in the painted frame. Its sole purpose is to give the
  reconciler something to mount so the effect's lifecycle is bound to
  the component instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    items:
        Data source. Plain lists render once on mount; ``Signal`` /
        callable sources are tracked reactively so newly-appended items
        flush to the static region.
    render_item:
        ``(item, index) -> Element``. Called once per item, in source
        order, with the absolute index inside the full list (so the
        callback can show line numbers if it wants).
    style:
        Reserved for parity with ink's ``style`` prop. Currently
        honoured only as a passthrough — every item is rendered
        independently and the container itself contributes zero size
        to layout, so per-side padding / margin on the container would
        have no effect.
