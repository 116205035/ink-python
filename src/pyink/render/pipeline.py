"""Render pipeline — entry point for live TUI rendering (PR5).

``render(tree, ...)`` mounts an Element tree, sets up the reactive
render loop, registers terminal-resize and Ctrl-C handlers, and returns
an :class:`pyink.render.instance.Instance`.

The render loop is a regular :func:`pyink.core.signal.effect`. Its body
runs a layout pass so any callable ``Text`` children that read
``signal.value`` do so *inside* the effect's tracking context — those
reads establish the subscriptions. The actual stdout write goes through
a :class:`pyink.render.instance._FpsThrottle`, which coalesces a burst
of signal writes into at most one paint per ``1/max_fps`` seconds.

Inline mode (PRD Decision 3) is the default. Alternate screen is
opt-in via ``alternate_screen=True``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tree:
        Root Element. Function-component bodies run exactly once during
        mount; subsequent state changes propagate through signals to the
        render loop.
    stdout:
        Where to write ANSI. Defaults to :data:`sys.stdout`.
    stdin:
        Where to read keyboard input from. Defaults to :data:`sys.stdin`.
        Useful for tests that drive synthetic input through the Terminal.
    columns / rows:
        Fixed viewport size. ``None`` auto-detects the real terminal
        size. Values that exceed the real terminal size are **clamped**
        to it — this is the root-cause fix for the "garbled borders on
        a short terminal" bug: when a caller hard-codes ``rows=30`` but
        the terminal only has 20 lines, the frame used to overflow the
        screen, the terminal scrolled, and the inline repaint's
        relative cursor-up math (which assumes every painted row is
        still on-screen) landed on the wrong rows — corrupting every
        subsequent frame. Values smaller than the real terminal are
        honoured as-is (the caller explicitly asked for a smaller
        viewport). Non-TTY envs fall back to the standard ``(80, 24)``
        default so tests driving PyInk through :class:`io.StringIO`
        keep working unchanged.
    alternate_screen:
        Enter the terminal's alternate screen buffer on mount and exit
        it on unmount. Default ``False`` (inline mode, PRD Decision 3).
    exit_on_ctrl_c:
        Treat ``SIGINT`` as a request to call :meth:`Instance.unmount`.
        Default ``True``. Disable to drive the lifecycle from Python
        directly.
    max_fps:
        Maximum frame rate the render loop will honour. Multiple signal
        writes inside one ``1/max_fps`` window collapse into a single
        paint.

    Returns
    -------
    Instance
        The live handle. Call :meth:`Instance.wait_until_exit` to block
        the calling thread, :meth:`Instance.unmount` to tear down.
