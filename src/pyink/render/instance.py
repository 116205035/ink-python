"""Instance — the live handle returned by :func:`pyink.render.render` (PR5).

A :class:`Instance` owns:

* The mounted root host instance (produced by the reconciler on mount).
* The render-loop effect that re-paints the screen whenever a signal the
  tree reads has changed.
* Bookkeeping for terminal state (alternate-screen toggle, atexit /
  SIGINT hooks).

PyInk is **not React** — function-component bodies run exactly once on
mount. State changes propagate via signals to subscribers in the
render-loop effect; the component tree itself never re-invokes. As a
consequence :meth:`Instance.rerender` is an unmount+mount, not a prop
diff.

Render-loop architecture:

1. On mount we create an :class:`pyink.core.signal.effect` whose body is
   :meth:`_effect_body`. The body schedules the actual paint
   through :class:`_FpsThrottle`; the throttle coalesces many writes
   into one paint per ``1/max_fps`` window.
2. *But* we still need the effect to subscribe to the signals the tree
   reads. The body therefore performs a layout pass too — the layout
   evaluates any callable ``Text`` children, which read ``signal.value``
   *inside* the effect's tracking context. Those reads establish the
   subscriptions; the resulting ``LayoutNode`` is thrown away (the
   throttle runs the layout again on the real paint). The cost is one
   extra layout per signal flush, which is negligible compared to a
   stdout write.

   Alternative considered (and rejected): exposing the signal module's
   tracking context so we could "subscribe without running the body".
   That would be a deeper change to :mod:`pyink.core.signal` and is out
   of scope for PR5.
