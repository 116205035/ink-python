"""Reactive signals core for PyInk.

Implements a SolidJS / Vue 3 / Preact-Signals style reactive system.

Public API (see PRD Decision 6 — ``.value`` attribute style):

* :func:`signal` — observable writable value.
* :func:`computed` — lazily-evaluated derived value with dependency tracking.
* :func:`effect` — side-effect that re-runs when dependencies change.
* :func:`ref` — non-reactive mutable reference.
* :func:`batch` — coalesce multiple writes into one notification.

Design constraints:

* Pure sync + threads (no asyncio).
* Thread safety via ``threading.RLock``.
* Dependency tracking via ``contextvars.ContextVar``.
* Circular ``computed`` raises :class:`CyclicDependency`.
