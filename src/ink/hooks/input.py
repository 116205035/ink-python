"""``use_input`` — subscribe to keyboard events (PR6).

Mirrors ink's ``useInput``. The handler receives a parsed
:class:`ink.render.keys.Key` for every keystroke. ``is_active=False``
pauses the subscription (useful for multi-input focus management).

Implementation notes:

* Raw mode is entered automatically by the :class:`Terminal` when the
  first ``on_key`` subscriber registers.
* The dispose is bound to the current component via
  :func:`ink.core.signal.effect`'s auto-binding mechanism: we create
  a no-op effect purely to obtain a dispose callback that's registered
  with the component instance. (Direct registration would require
  reaching into ``_current_component`` — using ``effect`` keeps the
  abstraction.)
* The default ``exit_on_ctrl_c`` behaviour (when raw mode is active) is
  handled by the render pipeline, which installs its own internal
  Ctrl+C listener. This hook just forwards keys.

    Parameters
    ----------
    handler:
        Called on the input-reader thread for every parsed keypress.
        Exceptions raised inside the handler are swallowed by the
        Terminal's dispatcher (so one bad handler can't kill the loop).
    is_active:
        When ``False`` the handler is not invoked. Toggling this at
        runtime (e.g. via a signal-driven flag) is the standard way to
        implement focus management between multiple input consumers.

    Returns
    -------
    dispose
        Call to unsubscribe. Also auto-invoked on component unmount.
