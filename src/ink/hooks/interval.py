"""``use_interval`` — periodically invoke a callback on a daemon thread (Phase 2 PR1).

Mirrors the common ``useInterval`` pattern from React/Vue TUI frameworks.
A background daemon thread sleeps for ``interval_ms`` between invocations
and calls ``callback`` on its own thread. Because PyInk signals are
thread-safe (per-signal ``RLock``), callbacks that write to signals are
safe — this is the canonical pattern for Spinner (PR2) and any
polling / clock display.

Implementation notes:

* The thread stops cleanly via a :class:`threading.Event`. ``dispose``
  sets the event; the loop's per-tick ``wait`` is sliced into short
  chunks (``_STOP_POLL_SECONDS``) so the worker observes the stop flag
  within ~50 ms even when ``interval_ms`` is large. ``dispose`` also
  joins the thread with a 1 s timeout as a safety net.
* ``interval_ms <= 0`` is treated as "do not start" — the dispose is
  still registered with the component (so unmount is a no-op) and the
  returned dispose is safe to call.
* ``is_active=False`` at mount time starts the thread paused. Toggling
  the pause later is not supported by the simple boolean form — callers
  that need runtime toggling should dispose + re-create the hook from a
  derived signal (PR2 Spinner does this naturally because its lifecycle
  matches the component's mount).
* Callback exceptions are swallowed + logged so a single bad tick can't
  kill the loop — matches the effect / key-dispatcher "swallow + continue"
  philosophy used elsewhere (see :func:`ink.core.signal._notify`).
* Like :func:`ink.hooks.use_input`, the dispose is auto-registered with
  the active :class:`ComponentInstance` via :func:`effect`'s binder hook,
  so component unmount tears the thread down automatically.

    """Periodically invoke ``callback`` every ``interval_ms`` milliseconds.

    Parameters
    ----------
    callback:
        Zero-arg callable invoked on the worker thread. Exceptions raised
        inside it are swallowed so the loop keeps ticking.
    interval_ms:
        Tick interval in milliseconds. Values ``<= 0`` are treated as
        "do not start" — the dispose is still registered with the
        component (so unmount is a no-op) and the returned dispose is
        safe to call.
    is_active:
        When ``False`` at mount time the loop is never started. Useful
        for conditionally enabling timers based on initial props.

    Returns
    -------
    dispose
        Stops the worker thread. Also auto-invoked on component unmount
        — callers usually don't need to manage this themselves.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If called outside a function-component body mounted via
        :func:`ink.render.render` (the hook needs an active
        :class:`ComponentInstance` to bind the cleanup to).
