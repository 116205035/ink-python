"""``StreamingText`` — stream-in text display (Phase 3 PR1).

Mirrors the Claude Code ``<StreamingText>`` pattern: a piece of text that
grows over time, optionally trailed by a cursor glyph and optionally
"smoothed" into a per-character reveal so the user sees a typing
animation rather than whole tokens popping in at once.

Three ``buffer`` shapes are supported (PRD Decision 5):

* :class:`ink.core.signal.Signal` ``[str]`` — reactive. Each ``.value``
  write re-renders the surrounding component because the layout-time
  callable child subscribes to the signal. This is the canonical shape
  for an AI stream: the network thread appends characters to the buffer
  signal, the render loop re-paints on every write.
* ``Callable[[], str]`` — evaluated lazily during layout, like any other
  callable ``Text`` child. Useful when the caller wants to compose
  multiple signals / refs into a single string without materialising an
  intermediate ``Computed``.
* ``str`` — static. Renders exactly the same way as a plain ``Text``,
  but still benefits from the optional ``cursor`` and ``reveal_speed``
  affordances (typing effect over a known string).

Design:

* ``reveal_speed == 0`` (default) is the **fast path**. We never touch
  :func:`ink.hooks.use_interval`; the buffer is concatenated with the
  cursor (if any) inside a callable child of a single ``Text``. This is
  the cheapest code path and the one most AI streaming UIs actually want
  — the network is already the bottleneck, no need to throttle on the
  render side.
* ``reveal_speed > 0`` flips to a function-component implementation that
  owns a private ``revealed`` count signal. A
  :func:`ink.hooks.use_interval` worker ticks the count up by one
  character at ``1000 / reveal_speed`` ms intervals, clamped to the
  current buffer length. The displayed text is ``buffer[:revealed]``,
  recomputed on every layout. The cursor sits after the last revealed
  character so it visually leads the typing.
* ``cursor`` defaults to ``None`` (no glyph). When set, it is appended
  verbatim to the displayed text. ``cursor_color`` wraps the glyph in an
  SGR sequence via :func:`ink.render.ansi.apply_style`; the layout
  measure pass already strips ANSI (CSI) sequences so the extra escape
  bytes don't inflate the column budget.

Cursor colour note: we deliberately emit the cursor *after* the leading
``reset`` that wraps the main text (when ``color`` is set) so the
cursor keeps its own colour independent of the text colour. A single
trailing ``reset`` is appended after the cursor so the colour does not
leak into subsequent output.

PR1 scope: ships ``StreamingText`` only. Markdown / HighlightedCode /
StructuredDiff land in later PRs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    buffer:
        Text source. Three shapes are accepted (see module docstring):

        * :class:`Signal` ``[str]`` — reactive. Each ``.value`` write
          re-renders the surrounding component.
        * ``Callable[[], str]`` — evaluated lazily during layout.
        * ``str`` — static.

        The buffer may grow (the canonical AI-stream case), stay fixed
        (a typing animation over a known string), or shrink (a stream
        reset).
    cursor:
        Glyph appended to the end of the displayed text (e.g. ``"▋"`` /
        ``"|"``). ``None`` (default) renders no cursor. The cursor sits
        *after* the last revealed character so it visually leads the
        typing when ``reveal_speed > 0``.
    cursor_color:
        Optional colour spec for ``cursor`` (same format as
        :func:`Text`'s ``color``: ``"green"``, ``"#00ff00"``,
        ``"rgb(0,255,0)"``, ``"ansi256(2)"``). When set, the glyph is
        wrapped in SGR sequences; layout ignores ANSI bytes so the
        cursor keeps its single-cell width.
    reveal_speed:
        Characters per second to reveal. ``0`` (default) shows the
        buffer immediately on every change — the recommended mode for
        real AI streams where the network is already throttling. A
        positive value enables a typing animation driven by
        :func:`ink.hooks.use_interval`; the displayed string grows by
        one character per tick until it catches up with the buffer.
    color:
        Forwarded to :func:`Text` as the text colour. Independent of
        ``cursor_color`` — set both to colour the cursor differently
        from the body.
    **text_props:
        Additional style props forwarded to :func:`Text`
        (``bold`` / ``italic`` / ``dimColor`` / ``wrap`` / …).

    Returns
    -------
    Element
        The fast path (``reveal_speed == 0``) returns a ``Text`` host
        element directly — no function component, no hooks. The
        reveal-speed branch returns an element whose ``type`` is
        :func:`_StreamingTextImpl`, a function component that owns a
        private ``revealed`` signal and an interval worker; that
        component is mounted by the reconciler, which is what makes
        ``Box(StreamingText(...), Text(...))`` safe to call from any
        context.

    Usage
    -----
    Reactive buffer::

        buf = signal("")
        # ... another thread appends characters ...
        Box(StreamingText(buf, cursor="▋"), padding=1)

    Static string with a typing effect::

        StreamingText("Hello, world!", cursor="|", reveal_speed=20)

    Callable buffer::

        StreamingText(lambda: f"{buf_a.value} / {buf_b.value}")
