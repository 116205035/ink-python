"""``SelectInput`` — keyboard-navigable option list (Phase 4 PR3).

Mirrors ``ink-select-input`` (and the multi-select variant from
``ink-multi-select``) at the level Phase 4 needs:

* Single-select — ``ArrowUp`` / ``ArrowDown`` / ``j`` / ``k`` move the
  highlight; ``Enter`` triggers :attr:`on_select` with the focused
  item's ``value``; numeric keys ``1``–``9`` jump directly to that
  index.
* Multi-select — ``Space`` toggles the focused item in/out of the
  selection set; ``Enter`` confirms the whole selection by triggering
  :attr:`on_select` with a ``list`` of selected values (sorted by
  index).
* ``on_change`` fires whenever the focused index moves (regardless of
  whether the move was triggered by arrows, ``j`` / ``k``, or a number
  key).
* ``is_active=False`` parks the input — the handler is registered with
  :func:`use_input` 's own ``is_active`` flag so toggling focus is
  cheap (no re-subscribe).

Design (per PRD Decision 4 + Phase 4 design notes):

* ``SelectInput`` is a factory returning an :class:`Element` whose
  ``type`` is the :func:`_SelectInputImpl` function component. The
  factory itself never runs hooks; only the wrapped function does,
  when the reconciler mounts it. This is the same shape as
  :func:`ink.externals.TextInput` (Phase 4 PR1) so callers can freely
  nest ``Box(SelectInput(...), Text(...))`` outside of a render
  context.
* Two :class:`Signal` s live inside the component: ``current`` (the
  focused index, clamped to ``[0, len(items) - 1]``) and ``selected``
  (a ``set[int]`` of indices, used only when ``multi_select=True``).
  The handler closure captures both and the render closure reads them
  through lazy callables so the render loop re-paints on each change.
* Callbacks (``on_select`` / ``on_change``) are captured in
  :class:`Ref` s refreshed every mount — this lets the caller swap
  callbacks between mounts without resubscribing the input handler.
* Items are normalised up-front to ``[{"label": str, "value": Any},
  ...]``: bare strings become ``{"label": s, "value": s}``, dicts must
  carry both ``label`` and ``value`` (anything else raises). Mixed
  str/dict lists are accepted; the helper coerces str entries.

Tab is intentionally *not* bound (PRD Decision 4 — SelectInput does
not own focus rotation; that's the job of an external
``use_focus_manager``). Esc is left for the surrounding pipeline
(``exit_on_ctrl_c`` / app-level cancel handlers).

Rendering:

* Each item is one :func:`Text` row.
* The focused row's prefix is the ``indicator`` glyph (``"❯"`` by
  default); non-focused rows get an all-space placeholder of the same
  width so the labels line up.
* In ``multi_select`` mode each row additionally carries
  ``selected_indicator`` (``"✓"``) when the item is in the selection
  set, or ``unselected_indicator`` (``" "``) otherwise.
* The focused row is rendered in ``selected_color`` (``"green"`` by
  default); non-focused rows inherit ``color`` (or no colour when
  ``color is None``).

Out of scope (Phase 4):

* Scrolling / ``limit`` / windowed rendering (ink-select-input's
  ``limit`` + ``rotateIndex`` dance). Every item is always rendered.
* A custom indicator / item component slot. The two indicators are
  strings; callers who want a custom glyph pass a different
  ``indicator``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    items:
        Options to render. Each entry is either a ``str`` (label and
        value are the same string) or a ``dict`` with ``"label"`` and
        ``"value"`` keys. Mixed lists (some ``str``, some ``dict``)
        are accepted. ``dict`` entries missing either key raise
        :class:`ValueError`; entries of any other type raise
        :class:`TypeError`.
    initial_index:
        Index of the row that should be focused on mount. Clamped to
        ``[0, len(items) - 1]``; out-of-range values silently settle
        on the nearest endpoint rather than raising.
    on_select:
        Called with the selected value when the user confirms a
        choice. In single-select mode this fires with the focused
        item's ``value`` on ``Enter``. In multi-select mode it fires
        with a ``list`` of the selected values (sorted by index) on
        ``Enter``. ``None`` (default) disables selection.
    on_change:
        Called with the new focus index whenever the highlight moves
        (arrows, ``j`` / ``k``, or a numeric jump). Not invoked for
        no-op moves (already at the boundary) or for ``Space`` /
        ``Enter``.
    multi_select:
        When ``True``, ``Space`` toggles the focused item's membership
        in the selection set and ``Enter`` triggers ``on_select`` with
        the whole selection as a list. When ``False`` (default),
        ``Space`` is ignored and ``Enter`` triggers ``on_select`` with
        the focused value.
    indicator:
        Glyph shown before the focused row. Defaults to ``"❯"``.
    selected_indicator:
        Glyph shown before each selected row in multi-select mode.
        Defaults to ``"✓"``.
    unselected_indicator:
        Glyph shown before each unselected row in multi-select mode.
        Defaults to a single space.
    color:
        Colour spec for non-focused rows (``"red"``, ``"#ff0000"``,
        ``"rgb(255,0,0)"``, ``"ansi256(9)"``). ``None`` (default)
        leaves them in the default terminal colour.
    selected_color:
        Colour spec applied to the focused row. Defaults to
        ``"green"``. Pass ``None`` to keep the focused row in the
        default colour.
    is_active:
        When ``False`` the input ignores all keystrokes. Toggle at
        runtime to switch focus between multiple ``SelectInput`` s.
    **box_props:
        Forwarded to the wrapping :func:`Box` (``padding``,
        ``borderStyle``, ``width``, …).

    Returns
    -------
    Element
        An element whose ``type`` is the :func:`_SelectInputImpl`
        function component. The factory itself never runs hooks — the
        reconciler mounts the function, which is what makes
        ``Box(SelectInput(...), Text(...))`` safe to call from outside
        a render context.

    Key bindings
    ------------
    * ``ArrowUp`` / ``k`` — move the focus up (clamps at top).
    * ``ArrowDown`` / ``j`` — move the focus down (clamps at bottom).
    * ``1``–``9`` — jump directly to that index.
    * ``Space`` (multi-select only) — toggle the focused item.
    * ``Enter`` — confirm (single-select fires ``on_select(value)``,
      multi-select fires ``on_select(list[value, ...])``).

    Tab and Esc are deliberately not handled here — Tab is owned by an
    external ``use_focus_manager`` (PRD Decision 4) and Esc / Ctrl+C
    are owned by the surrounding exit / cancel pipeline.
