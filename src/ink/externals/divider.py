"""``Divider`` — visual section separator (Phase 2 PR4).

Mirrors :mod:`ink-divider`: a single horizontal or vertical line that
optionally carries a centred label. PyInk's flavour collapses
ink-divider's ``dividerChar`` / ``dividerColor`` / ``titleColor`` /
``titlePadding`` knobs into the props the PRD calls out — ``border_style``
picks the character family, ``color`` paints the whole line (and any
label) uniformly, and ``padding`` controls the label's left/right gutters.

Design (per PRD PR4 scope):

* ``Divider`` is a thin factory that returns a ``box`` host element —
  no hooks, no function component. This puts it in the same category as
  :func:`ink.components.Spacer`: a declarative composition over the
  existing ``borderStyle`` machinery rather than a component with a
  lifecycle. Renderers already know how to paint single edges (the
  ``borderTop`` / ``borderRight`` / ``borderBottom`` / ``borderLeft``
  visibility flags shipped in PR4), so we just configure them.
* Horizontal layout builds a ``box`` whose only visible edge is the
  bottom one and lets ``flexGrow=1`` stretch it across the available
  width. This is exactly the trick :mod:`ink-divider`'s
  ``BaseDivider`` uses (``borderBottom / flexGrow=1``); we keep the
  pattern verbatim because the renderer already fills an edge across
  the full box width, which is what makes the line span the parent
  column automatically.
* Vertical layout flips the same idea: only the left edge is shown and
  ``flexGrow=1`` makes the box grow vertically inside a row parent.
* Label mode wraps two of those single-edge boxes around a :func:`Text`
  leaf. Both flanking dividers carry ``flexGrow=1`` so the flex engine
  splits the remaining main-axis space evenly and the label lands
  centred without us having to measure it ourselves. ``padding`` adds
  the requested spaces on either side of the label.
* Unknown ``border_style`` falls back to ``"single"`` rather than
  raising — the renderer's ``resolve_border_chars`` would otherwise
  reject the prop with a ``ValueError``, which is too loud for a
  cosmetic choice. (Callers who want strict validation can pass a
  custom ``dict`` through ``border_style`` just like they can to
  ``Box(borderStyle=...)``.)

Width / height: the PRD exposes them as overrides for cases where the
parent doesn't have a usable main axis (a ``Box`` with
``flexDirection="column"`` and no explicit width, or a ``Box`` with
``flexDirection="row"`` and no explicit height). When ``None`` we
rely on ``flexGrow=1``; when set, we pin the dimension and skip the
grow so the caller's value wins.

PR4 scope: ships ``Divider`` only. Context / focus land in PR5/6.

    """Render a visual divider line, optionally carrying a centred label.

    Parameters
    ----------
    label:
        Text shown in the middle of a horizontal divider
        (``"── label ──"``). ``None`` renders a plain line. Only the
        horizontal layout honours this prop — vertical dividers ignore
        it (mirroring ink-divider, which is horizontal-only upstream).
    direction:
        ``"horizontal"`` (default) paints a single row of the border's
        ``bottom`` character. ``"vertical"`` paints a single column of
        the border's ``left`` character — useful between siblings in a
        row container. Any other value raises ``ValueError``.
    border_style:
        Named border alias (``"single"`` / ``"double"`` / ``"round"``
        / ``"bold"`` / ``"singleDouble"`` / ``"doubleSingle"`` /
        ``"classic"`` / ``"arrow"``) or a custom 8-key
        :data:`ink.render.ansi.BorderStyle` dict. Unknown aliases
        fall back to ``"single"`` so a typo never crashes the render.
    color:
        Colour spec forwarded to ``borderColor`` (and to the label's
        ``color``). Applied uniformly so the line and label share the
        same hue — pass ``None`` to inherit the terminal default.
    width:
        Pin the horizontal divider's width in cells. ``None`` (default)
        lets ``flexGrow=1`` fill the parent's main axis; useful when
        the parent has no resolvable width (e.g. a top-level
        ``flexDirection="column"`` Box without a width). Ignored for
        vertical dividers.
    height:
        Pin the vertical divider's height in rows. ``None`` (default)
        lets ``flexGrow=1`` fill the parent's main axis. Ignored for
        horizontal dividers.
    padding:
        Number of spaces to insert on each side of ``label``. Defaults
        to ``0``; pass ``1`` to reproduce ink-divider's look.

    Returns
    -------
    Element
        A ``box`` host element (plain or wrapped around children when
        a label is present). No function component is involved — the
        factory is purely declarative, which makes
        ``Box(Divider(), Text("..."))`` safe to call from any context.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``direction`` is neither ``"horizontal"`` nor ``"vertical"``.
