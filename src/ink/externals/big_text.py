"""``BigText`` — ASCII art banner text via :mod:`pyfiglet` (Phase 6 PR2).

Mirrors :mod:`ink-big-text`, which delegates to :mod:`cfonts` for the
glyph data. PyInk's flavour delegates to :mod:`pyfiglet` (a FIGlet
port) — 300+ fonts, multi-row output, and full Unicode / ASCII
coverage out of the box. The hand-rolled font registry that shipped
in earlier PRs is gone; ``pyfiglet`` covers strictly more glyphs and
fonts than we could ever ship inline.

Design (per PRD PR2 scope):

* ``BigText`` is a thin declarative factory that returns a ``box``
  column element — no hooks, no function component. The whole banner
  is built eagerly at call time via a single
  :func:`pyfiglet.Figlet.renderText` call.
* :mod:`pyfiglet` is an *optional* dependency. The factory
  ``import``\\ s it lazily inside the function body; if the package is
  missing we raise an ``ImportError`` whose message points the caller
  at the right extra (``pip install ink[big-text]``). Nothing else
  in PyInk imports ``pyfiglet``, so the optional group only matters
  when this component is actually used.
* ``font`` is forwarded to :class:`pyfiglet.Figlet` verbatim
  (``"standard"`` / ``"block"`` / ``"shadow"`` / ``"digital"`` /
  ``"banner"`` / ``"big"`` / ...). Unknown font names raise
  :class:`pyfiglet.FontNotFound` — we let that propagate rather than
  swallowing it, because a typo in the font name is almost always a
  bug the caller wants to hear about (matching
  :func:`HighlightedCode`'s "no silent fallback" stance).
* ``align`` is forwarded to pyfiglet's ``justify`` option (one of
  ``"left"`` / ``"center"`` / ``"right"``). Unknown values fall back
  to ``"left"`` so a typo doesn't crash the render — pyfiglet itself
  only accepts those three strings, so we normalise before handing
  off.
* ``colors`` paints the banner's rows in alternating hues. The list
  is cycled modulo its length: ``["red", "yellow"]`` paints row 0
  red, row 1 yellow, row 2 red, …, mirroring :mod:`ink-big-text`'s
  ``colors`` prop (which does the same per-row cycle). ``color`` (the
  single-colour prop) still works and is applied uniformly to every
  row; when both ``color`` and ``colors`` are passed, ``colors``
  wins on its rows and ``color`` fills any rows beyond
  ``len(colors)`` (defensive — callers should pick one).
* ``width`` is forwarded to pyfiglet's ``width`` option (default
  ``80``). The renderer wraps long banners at this column budget;
  pass a wider value for long strings, narrower for tight layouts.

Cross-layer note: pyfiglet output is plain ASCII (or Unicode block
characters for some fonts) with no ANSI sequences, so
:func:`ink.layout.string_width` measures every cell as one column
and the banner's rendered width matches pyfiglet's output exactly.

PR2 scope: ships ``BigText`` only. The ``block`` / ``simple``
hand-rolled fonts that shipped before this PR are gone — ``pyfiglet``
covers them and hundreds more.

    """Render ASCII art banner text via :mod:`pyfiglet`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    text:
        String to render. pyfiglet handles the full Unicode range;
        characters outside the font's coverage render as a blank
        glyph of the font's standard row width so the banner layout
        stays intact.
    font:
        pyfiglet font name (``"standard"`` / ``"block"`` /
        ``"shadow"`` / ``"digital"`` / ``"banner"`` / ``"big"`` /
        … — pyfiglet ships 300+). Unknown names raise
        :class:`pyfiglet.FontNotFound` rather than falling back; a
        typo in the font name is a caller bug worth surfacing.
    colors:
        Per-row colour cycle. The list is cycled modulo its length:
        ``["red", "yellow"]`` paints row 0 red, row 1 yellow, row 2
        red, … (mirroring :mod:`ink-big-text`'s ``colors`` prop).
        Colour specs use PyInk's named-colour vocabulary (``"red"``,
        ``"#ff0000"``, ``"rgb(255,0,0)"``, ``"ansi256(9)"``). When
        ``None``, every row inherits the terminal default unless
        ``color`` is set.
    align:
        Horizontal alignment within the pyfiglet render box. One of
        ``"left"`` / ``"center"`` / ``"right"``. Anything else falls
        back to ``"left"``. This is *pyfiglet's* alignment (it
        pre-pads the rendered rows to ``width``) — it is independent
        of the surrounding flex layout's ``justifyContent``.
    width:
        Maximum column budget handed to pyfiglet (default ``80``).
        Long banners wrap at this width; pass a larger value for
        long strings, narrower for tight layouts.
    color:
        Optional single colour applied uniformly to every row. When
        both ``color`` and ``colors`` are passed, ``colors`` wins on
        its rows and ``color`` fills any rows beyond
        ``len(colors)`` (defensive — callers should pick one).
    **box_props:
        Forwarded to the outer ``Box`` container (``flexDirection``
        is always set to ``"column"`` and cannot be overridden — the
        component's contract is "one row per pyfiglet output line").
        Useful props include ``borderStyle`` / ``padding`` /
        ``width`` / ``backgroundColor``.

    Returns
    -------
    Element
        A ``box`` host element (``flexDirection="column"``) whose
        children are one :func:`Text` leaf per pyfiglet output row.
        No function component is involved — the factory is purely
        declarative.

    Raises
    ------
    ImportError
        If :mod:`pyfiglet` is not installed. The error message points
        the caller at ``pip install ink[big-text]``.
    TypeError
        If ``text`` is not a ``str``.
