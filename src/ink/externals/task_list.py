"""``TaskList`` — task-state list with per-task spinner (Phase 6 PR1).

Mirrors :mod:`ink-task-list`: a column of tasks where each row carries
an icon that reflects the task's current lifecycle state. PyInk's
flavour keeps the upstream state set verbatim (``pending`` /
``running`` / ``done`` / ``error`` / ``warning``) but collapses the
label / status / output triplet into ``label`` + ``output`` — the
optional ``status`` bracket-text was rarely used upstream and removing
it keeps the dataclass self-explanatory.

Design (per PRD PR1 scope):

* :class:`TaskItem` is a ``@dataclass(frozen=True)`` value object. The
  immutability lets callers treat each task as a stable identity and
  swap state by replacing the entry rather than mutating it — the
  common pattern for a CLI that progresses a task list through stages.
* ``TaskList`` is a factory returning an :class:`Element` whose
  ``type`` is a function component (:func:`_TaskListImpl`). The factory
  itself never runs hooks — only the wrapped function does, when the
  reconciler mounts it. This matches :func:`ink.externals.Spinner`'s
  contract so ``Box(TaskList(tasks), Text("..."))`` is safe to call
  from outside a render context.
* Three ``tasks`` shapes are accepted (mirroring
  :mod:`ink.externals.markdown` / :mod:`ink.externals.diff` /
  :mod:`ink.externals.streaming_text`):

  * ``list[TaskItem]`` — static. Rendered eagerly at mount time; the
    tree never re-renders on its own.
  * :class:`Signal` ``[list[TaskItem]]`` — reactive on the *row
    content*. Each row's icon + label + output is wrapped in a
    layout-time callable child that re-reads the signal, so state
    transitions (pending → done) repaint on the next frame. New /
    removed tasks still require a remount (the row count is fixed at
    mount time — documented limitation; see ``_TaskListImpl``).
  * ``Callable[[], list[TaskItem]]`` — evaluated lazily at layout
    time, same reactivity story as ``Signal``.

* ``running`` rows mount a real :func:`Spinner` so the icon animates
  independently on its own interval worker. The other states emit
  static unicode glyphs (``○`` / ``✓`` / ``✗`` / ``⚠``) coloured to
  match the upstream palette (gray / green / red / yellow).
* ``on_complete`` fires once when every task reaches a terminal state
  (``done`` / ``error`` / ``warning``). The check runs inside a
  :func:`ink.core.signal.effect` so a transition into the
  all-terminal configuration re-evaluates immediately; a module-level
  ref guards against duplicate invocation (the effect re-runs on every
  relevant signal write even when the result is unchanged).

PR1 scope: ships ``TaskList`` and ``TaskItem`` only.
ProgressBar / Gradient / Table / BigText land in later PRs.

        ``done`` (green ``✓``) / ``error`` (red ``✗``) /
        ``warning`` (yellow ``⚠``).
    output:
        Optional secondary line shown below the label, dimmed. Useful
        for a one-line summary of what the task produced (e.g. ``"3

    Parameters
    ----------
    tasks:
        Task list. Three shapes are accepted (see module docstring):

        * ``list[TaskItem]`` — static.
        * :class:`Signal` ``[list[TaskItem]]`` — reactive row content.
        * ``Callable[[], list[TaskItem]]`` — lazily evaluated at layout
          time, same reactivity story as ``Signal``.
    spinner_type:
        Frame sequence name forwarded to :func:`Spinner` for
        ``running`` rows. Defaults to ``"dots"``. Unknown names
        silently fall back to ``"dots"`` (Spinner's own behaviour).
    spinner_color:
        Optional colour spec forwarded to :func:`Spinner`. ``None``
        inherits the terminal default.
    on_complete:
        Callback invoked once when every task reaches a terminal
        state (``done`` / ``error`` / ``warning``). Receives the final
        task list. ``None`` (default) disables the check.

        The callback fires from inside a reactive
        :func:`ink.core.signal.effect`, which runs on the render
        thread — keep the body cheap (no blocking I/O) to avoid
        stalling the frame loop.
    **box_props:
        Forwarded to the outer ``Box`` container. ``flexDirection`` is
        always overridden to ``"column"`` (the row list is intrinsically
        vertical); pass-through props like ``margin`` / ``padding`` /
        ``gap`` are applied verbatim.

    Returns
    -------
    Element
        An element whose ``type`` is a function component
        (:func:`_TaskListImpl`). The factory itself never runs hooks —
        the wrapped function is invoked by the reconciler on mount,
        which is what makes ``Box(TaskList(tasks), Text("..."))`` safe
        to call from outside a render context.
