"""``ProgressBar`` — character-cell progress bar (Phase 6 PR2).

Mirrors :mod:`ink-progress-bar`: a horizontal bar whose filled portion
grows proportionally with ``value`` and (optionally) a trailing
percentage readout. PyInk's flavour collapses ink-progress-bar's
``percent`` (0-1) / ``columns`` / ``left`` / ``right`` / ``rightPad``
knobs into a simpler ``value`` + ``width`` + ``show_percentage`` API,
matching how the component is actually used in CLI UIs.

Design (per PRD PR2 scope):

* ``ProgressBar`` is a function component. On mount it resolves the
  ``value`` source (``float`` / ``Signal[float]`` /
  ``Callable[[], float]``), clamps to ``[0.0, 1.0]``, computes the
  filled / remaining character counts, and emits a single ``Text``
  leaf carrying the composed string and the caller's ``color``.
* The string is built inside a layout-time callable child so a
  reactive ``Signal`` / ``Callable`` source re-paints on every write
  — the same pattern :func:`ink.externals.Spinner` uses for its
  frame index.
* ``width`` is the bar width in cells (excluding the optional
  percentage suffix). ``character`` fills the completed portion and
  ``remaining_character`` fills the rest so the bar always occupies
  exactly ``width`` cells, regardless of ``value``.
* ``show_percentage=True`` (default) appends ``" NN%"`` (zero-padded
  to 3 digits so the suffix width is stable across renders — a
  flapping width causes the surrounding layout to jitter). ``False``
  suppresses the suffix entirely.
* ``character`` / ``remaining_character`` default to the Unicode
  block elements ``█`` (U+2588) and ``░`` (U+2591), matching the
  upstream defaults. Callers may pass any single-character string
  (e.g. ``"="`` / ``"-"`` for ASCII-only terminals).
* ``value`` outside ``[0.0, 1.0]`` is clamped rather than rejected —
  the typical caller is computing a ratio and a transient overshoot
  (e.g. ``1.0000001`` from float arithmetic) shouldn't crash.

Cross-layer note: the bar is emitted as a single ``text`` leaf rather
than a ``box`` row because the layout engine's flex model isn't
needed — ``width`` pins the cell count and the percentage suffix
sits inline at the end. ``Box(ProgressBar(...), Text("..."))``
composes naturally because the ``Text`` leaf is just another inline
sibling.

PR2 scope: ships ``ProgressBar`` only.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value:
        Completion ratio in the range ``[0.0, 1.0]``. Values outside
        the range are clamped (a transient overshoot from float
        arithmetic won't crash). Accepts a plain ``float``, a
        :class:`Signal` ``[float]``, or a 0-arg ``Callable`` returning
        ``float``; the latter two re-paint on every write via a
        layout-time subscription.
    width:
        Bar width in cells (excluding the optional percentage
        suffix). Defaults to 30. ``<= 0`` suppresses the bar portion
        entirely, leaving only the suffix (useful when the caller
        wants a bare percentage readout).
    character:
        Cell character for the completed portion. Defaults to
        ``█`` (U+2588 FULL BLOCK).
    remaining_character:
        Cell character for the unfilled portion. Defaults to ``░``
        (U+2591 LIGHT SHADE).
    color:
        Optional colour spec forwarded to the emitted :func:`Text`
        leaf (``"red"``, ``"#ff0000"``, ``"rgb(255,0,0)"``,
        ``"ansi256(9)"``). Applied uniformly to the whole bar
        (filled + remaining + suffix); pass ``None`` to inherit the
        terminal default.
    show_percentage:
        When ``True`` (default), appends ``" NN%"`` (zero-padded to
        three digits) so the suffix width is stable across renders.
        ``False`` suppresses the suffix entirely.
    **props:
        Forwarded to the emitted :func:`Text` leaf. Supports every
        style prop :func:`Text` accepts (``bold`` / ``underline`` /
        etc.).

    Returns
    -------
    Element
        An element whose ``type`` is a function component
        (:func:`_ProgressBarImpl`). The factory itself never reads
        ``value`` — the wrapped function does, when the reconciler
        mounts it.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If ``value`` is not a ``float`` / ``Signal`` / callable, or
        if ``width`` is not an ``int``.
