"""Layout-time context for the current text-leaf measurement width.

Some text leaves carry callables whose rendered output depends on the
available width (e.g. ``Markdown``'s reactive branch, which pre-renders
the Markdown to a snapshot string). Without knowing the actual width
the parent's content box grants the leaf, the callable falls back to
the viewport width and produces snapshot strings that overflow their
container — manifesting as scrambled nested-box borders during
streaming Markdown re-render.

The width is exposed via a :class:`contextvars.ContextVar` set by the
layout engine around text-leaf measurement. Code that needs the
current width calls :func:`get_current_text_width`; ``None`` means
"the layout pass did not establish a finite width" (e.g. measurement
under unbounded width), in which case callers should fall back to a
sensible default (typically the viewport width).
