"""Integration test — counter demo with a real signal + threaded timer (PR5).

Mirrors the kind of "live" demo we expect users to write. Uses a fake
:class:`io.StringIO` stdout (no real TTY required) so it runs in CI.

The contract: after starting a render that updates a signal from a
background thread, the captured stdout must contain at least two
distinct frame contents (the initial paint plus at least one repaint
after the signal tick).
