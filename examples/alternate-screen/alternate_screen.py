"""Alternate-screen example — full-screen UI with scrollback preservation.

Reference: ink's ``render(tree, { stdout, stdin })`` alternate-screen
mode and the ``alternate-screen`` npm package.

PyInk ships the same capability as a keyword argument to
:func:`ink.render.render`: pass ``alternate_screen=True`` and the
pipeline emits ``\\x1b[?1049h`` on mount and ``\\x1b[?1049l`` on
unmount. The atexit + SIGINT hooks registered by the Instance guarantee
the main screen buffer is restored even when the process crashes —
the user's previous scrollback is preserved.

Run::

    python examples/alternate-screen/alternate_screen.py

Controls:

* Esc / Ctrl+C — quit (the alternate screen is exited and the previous
  terminal contents, including scrollback, are restored).

What to verify manually:

1. ``echo "scrollback line" && python examples/alternate-screen/alternate_screen.py``
   shows the example full-screen UI.
2. Quit with Esc or Ctrl+C — the terminal returns to the previous
   buffer and ``scrollback line`` is still on screen.
