"""StreamingText example — animated streaming text (Phase 3 PR6).

Reference: Claude Code's ``<StreamingText>`` pattern. A background thread
appends characters to a pair of ``Signal[str]`` buffers one at a time,
simulating an AI token stream. Two ``StreamingText`` mounts read from
the buffers with different ``reveal_speed`` settings so the user can
compare the **instant** path (``reveal_speed=0`` — characters appear as
soon as the buffer grows) with the **smooth** path (``reveal_speed=20``
chars/s — a typing animation that trails the buffer).

Both mounts use ``cursor='▋'`` and ``cursor_color='green'`` so the
leading cursor glyph is visible while the stream is in flight.

No optional dependency is required — ``StreamingText`` ships in core
``ink.externals``.

Run::

    python examples/streaming-text/streaming_text_demo.py

Controls:

* Esc / Ctrl+C — quit
