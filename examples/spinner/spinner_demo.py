"""Spinner example — animated loading indicators (Phase 2 PR2).

Reference: ink-spinner's CLI demo. PyInk ships the canonical ``cli-spinners``
frame data via :data:`ink.externals.SPINNERS`; this example mounts a small
gallery of them side by side, each labelled with its name and painted in a
different colour so the frames are easy to tell apart at a glance.

Each spinner runs on its own ``use_interval`` worker thread (started by the
``Spinner`` external). The frame index lives in a signal the component
writes to from the worker; the render loop subscribes through the callable
``Text`` child and re-paints on every tick.

Run::

    python examples/spinner/spinner_demo.py

Controls:

* Esc / Ctrl+C — quit
