"""StructuredDiff example — file-edit diff display (Phase 3 PR6).

Reference: Claude Code's ``<StructuredDiff>`` component. Two snapshots
of a Python module are diffed via ``difflib.unified_diff`` and rendered
as a column of coloured rows — green for additions, red for deletions,
magenta for hunk headers, default colour for context lines. When
Pygments is installed, the ``+`` / ``-`` row bodies additionally get
syntax highlighting.

The demo mounts three variants side by side:

* the default (``context_lines=3``) with the language set to Python so
  Pygments colours the bodies,
* a zero-context variant (``context_lines=0``) that shows only the
  changed lines,
* a "no Pygments" simulation rendered with ``language="text"`` so the
  fallback path is visible even when Pygments is installed.

Optional dependency: per-line syntax highlighting requires Pygments.
Install with::

    pip install ink[highlight]

Without Pygments installed, the diff machinery still works — the
``+`` / ``-`` rows just render as plain coloured ``Text``.

Run::

    python examples/diff/diff_demo.py

Controls:

* Esc / Ctrl+C — quit
