"""Markdown + StreamingText example — live AI token stream (Phase 3 PR6).

Reference: Claude Code's chat UI. A background thread appends characters
one at a time to a ``Signal[str]``; the ``Markdown`` external accepts
the signal as its source and re-parses on every write, so the user sees
the Markdown render grow live — partial headings, half-finished code
blocks and incomplete tables all render gracefull until the source
completes.

This is the closest of the Phase 3 examples to a real Jarvis / Claude
Code chat surface: AI token stream on one thread, Markdown render on
the main thread.

Optional dependencies: requires both ``markdown-it-py`` and Pygments
(for highlighted code blocks inside the rendered Markdown). Install
with::

    pip install ink[all]

Partial-source handling: ``markdown-it-py`` parses what it can. An
unclosed fence (```` ``` ```` without a matching close) renders as a
plain code block; an unclosed link renders as literal text. The render
is always graceful — never raises.

Run::

    python examples/markdown-streaming/markdown_streaming_demo.py

Controls:

* Esc / Ctrl+C — quit
