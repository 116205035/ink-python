"""computed + batch example — derived state and write coalescing.

Reference: SolidJS / Vue 3 / Preact Signals' ``computed`` + ``batch``.

PyInk ships two reactive primitives that this demo exercises together:

* :func:`ink.computed` — a lazily-evaluated derived value that
  re-computes whenever one of its source signals changes. ``double``
  here is ``computed(lambda: count.value * 2)``.
* :func:`ink.batch` — coalesce multiple writes into a single
  notification flush. Writing 5 times inside a ``with batch:`` block
  notifies every subscriber **once**, not five times.

The demo tracks how many times an ``effect`` body has run via a
separate counter signal. Compare:

* Press ``+`` — runs ``count.value += 1`` five times inside one
  ``batch`` → ``effect`` fires **once**, but ``count`` jumps by 5.
* Press ``-`` — runs ``count.value -= 1`` once per press → every
  press triggers an ``effect`` re-run.

The side-by-side comparison makes the value of ``batch`` obvious:
one user keystroke can mutate many signals while still producing
exactly one repaint.

Run::

    python examples/computed-batch/computed_batch.py

Controls:

* ``+`` — batched increment (5 writes, 1 effect run).
* ``-`` — single decrement (1 write, 1 effect run each).
* Ctrl+C — quit.
